port scanning tools benefit from nmap which writin in python 
intended to ease the process of checking online hosts and do 
information gathering on host/hosts currently can do nmap 
scan with options :
args[ -T4 -sVC -oN file-name ] for enmurations scan 
args[ -T4 -A  -sVC -oN file-name] for intense scan 

with hoping to add more option such banner graber and similar
function aiding information gathering .
